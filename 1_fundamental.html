<!-- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the basic building block of the Web. 
    It defines the meaning and structure of web content. -->
<!doctype html> <!-- Telling the browser what version of HTML it is engaging with,
    html by default here means the HTML5 version, in other versions exclusivity is required!-->
<!-- HTML consists of a series of elements, which you we to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content 
    to make it appear or act in a certain way. 
    The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on -->
<html lang="en-US"><!-- Contains the Contents of a web page -->
    <head>
        <!-- The head of an HTML document is the part that is not displayed in the web browser when the page is loaded. 
            It contains information such as the page <title>, links to CSS (if you choose to style your HTML content with CSS),
            links to custom favicons, and 
            other metadata (data about the HTML, such as the author, and important keywords that describe the document). 
            Web browsers use information contained in the head to render the HTML document correctly -->
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <meta name="authur" content="Mj Islam Mir" >
        <meta name="description" content="This is the practice session of HTML CSS Javascript">
        <!-- Feeding http header with the information -->
        <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="2000"> <!--Other http-equivalent values contentext-type,content-security-policy, default-style-->
        <!-- Metadata is data that describes data, and HTML has an "official" way of adding metadata to a document — the <meta> element. -->
        <!-- The <meta> HTML element represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, 
            like <base>, <link>, <script>, <style> or <title> -->
        <!-- document's character encoding — the character set that the document is permitted to use. utf-8 is a universal character set that includes pretty much any character from any human language.  -->
        <meta property="og:author" content="Mj islam Mir">
        <!-- above is the way of using metadata using Open Graph Data, a metadata protocal introduced by facebook  -->
        <!-- One effect of this is that when you link to MDN Web Docs on Facebook, the link appears along with an image and description: a richer experience for users. -->
        <title><!--used to add a title to the html document-->
            <!-- titile element is metadata that represents the title of the overall HTML document (not the document's content.) -->
